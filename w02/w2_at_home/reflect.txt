1- What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?
I think the most important thing i've learned in this assignment was how to troubleshoot. I was
getting weird bugs while I was working on this assignment. I have to look up the microsoft solutions
and even then I didn't understand the bug. I also reached out to a software developer that I work
with to have a fresh eye since I was wracking my brain around it for the past few days and couldn't 
figure it out.

2- Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?
.005 needs to be added because that is how much that needs to be added when calculating the GST owing.
This would be considering the tax owing in the problem

3- What is the result of a casting operation?
the result of a casting operation is to convert a variable from one kind of data type to another
kind of data type. For example in this assignment, we have done the int into a float type.

4- Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?
I think that it was best to use the modulus operator in this workshop was because we've recently
learned it in our lecture courses. The modulas operator (%) shows the remainder that results
from the problem. This was essential in our assignment because it was all dealing with numbers
and money.
