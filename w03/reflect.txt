1) The iteration construct I used was do while for my code to create this.
2) The difference between while and do while is that in do-while, the code
	block is executed at least once. The do-while loop runs at least
	once, even though the condition is given is false.
	With the while loop, the condition is at the beggining of the loop
	block, and makes possible to never enter the loop. In while loop, the
	condition is first tested and then the code block is executed if the 
	test result is true. 
3) Conditional expression has a few different actions. There is the boolean 
	which is for telling whether a statement is true or false. Looking 
	into boolean a bit further, if the statement is true then it would
	equal to 1. If the state is false then it would equal to 0.
