1) One of the advantages of using an array of structs vs parallel arrays is that you are working with one array.
   You can have many different variables of different types all controlled under one array, which is easier for calling and
   assigning input whereas with parallel arrays you must keep track of two arrays and update the information together or it 
   can mess up the order.

2) The reason the preferred method of declaring a struct type is in a header file is so that the struct is initiallized 
   globally vs locally, meaning you only have to initialize it once and all the codes will be able to use it vs having to 
   initialize it multiple times.
