3. The functions findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone benefit my source code a lot because of how frequently they are used.
   The code within these functions is needed throughout the source code so having functions instead makes the code shorter
   and easier to read, as well as cleaner and efficient. 

4. I think I learned how to implement functions within one another better with assignment two. I am much more comfortable
   dealing with larger assignments as well because it becomes easier to break it down into functions and working at it in 
   parts.
