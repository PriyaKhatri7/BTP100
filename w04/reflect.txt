1) The arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements because there is no way (that I currently know of) to
   declare the size of an array using an inputted value. Since 10 is the maximum number of days accepted, an array with size
   10 is perfect as it will work in any situation for this program. Using a smaller value (ex. 4 days) will still work.

2) The advantages of using matching arrays is that it is an efficient way of getting corresponding information saved. When 
   having to sets of data that go along together, matching arrays used in one for loop for example is clean and efficient. 
   Some disadvantages is that matching arrays must have data that matches, in other words if there is not a similar pattern
   between to sets of data (ex. day and weather, test and grade), matching arrays are useless. Another possible disadvantage
   is RAM efficency. Like in this program having set two arrays to a max size, if the whole array is not used it essentially
   is taking up space for no reason. 

3)I think the home portion was actually just right. Some of it was really similar to the previous workshop (the average), but
  getting the loops to work in order for the user to continue getting averages, the program checking if the input is valid, 
  and the user wanting to quit was a bit of a challenge. The whole part was not challenging so I would say it was just right.
